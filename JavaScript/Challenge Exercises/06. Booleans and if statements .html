            Continuing from exercise 6d, lets say the discount is only available
            if its not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday =true;
            * Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must
              meet the age requirement and it is also not a holiday.
            * NOTE: && has higher priority than || so you may need to use
              brackets () to control which code gets done first.
            * Try changing the value of isHoliday to display different messages.
